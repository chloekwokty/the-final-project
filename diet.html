                <h3 class="centertext"> What is it? </h3>
                <p> A ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. It involves drastically reducing
                </br>carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called
                </br>ketosis.Ketones are produced if you eat very few carbs (that are quickly broken down into blood sugar) and only
                </br>moderate amounts of protein (excess protein can also be converted to blood sugar). The liver produces ketone
               </br>from fat. These ketones then serve as a fuel source throughout the body, especially for the brain. </p>
